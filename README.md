# NFL-EDA
Growing up as a New England kid in the 90s it wasn't always easy, because it seemed like everything went the opposite of a fairy tale for Boston sports fans, whether it was Super Bowl 31 or the Red Sox inevitably falling to the Yankees to not make the postseason; however,little did I know as I entered into my formative teenage years the transcendent path my childhood New England Patriots would be set on starting in 2001. 

In this project, I am performing an exploratory data analysis on the popular NFL Python Package, nfl_data_py to analyze the 2001 Super Bowl winning New England Patriots led by the most unlikely of heroes (at the time), Tom Brady.
